Testing the API
You can use Postman or curl to test the endpoints:

Register Member:

sh
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/members/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123", "name": "John Doe", "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01", "gender": "male", "address": "123 Main St", "subscribeToNewsletter": true}'
Get Profile:

sh
Copy code
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/members/profile -H "Authorization: Bearer faketoken_user1"
Edit Profile:

sh
Copy code
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/members/edit-profile -H "Authorization: Bearer faketoken_user1" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"dateOfBirth": "1991-01-01", "address": "456 Elm St"}'
Delete Account:

sh
Copy code
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/members/delete-account -H "Authorization: Bearer faketoken_user1"
Change Password:

sh
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/change-password -H "Authorization: Bearer faketoken_user1" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"currentPassword": "password123", "newPassword": "newpassword123", "confirmPassword": "newpassword123"}'
This basic implementation should give you a good starting point for your RESTful API project. You can further enhance it with additional features, such as connecting to a real database, more robust error handling, and improved security measures.
